# Title - Why Your Productivity Sucks (And Always Will)

## Introduction 

You've tried everything:
- A to-do list
- A habit tracker
- Time blocking
- A second brain for your notes
- Even a $15 calendar (even though Google Calendar is free)

You watch productivity videos, take notes, read books, journal, listen to podcasts, constantly chasing that one method that will finally fix your procrastination, laziness, and lack of motivation.

But deep down you know the problem isn't the tools. It's you.

Sounds harsh maybe, but let's be real—if productivity worked the way we wish it did, wouldn't we all be productive by now? Yet here you are, still stuck.

If that hit a little too close to home, welcome to the club, because you're not alone.

## Personal Experience [00:39-01:48]

I was a part of this productivity community for years, trying to find the perfect apps, watching content, and testing every hack imaginable. And you know what? I was convinced that all of this was making me better.

But then I started asking myself some uncomfortable and challenging questions:
- Why do I keep consuming productivity content instead of just doing the work?
- Why do I feel like I'm improving when my actual results haven't changed that much?
- And here's the big one: What if I had never seen any of those videos? Would I actually be worse off?

The truth is, a lot of people get stuck in this productivity loop—optimizing, tweaking, searching for the perfect system. But at the end of the day, they're just *busy*. They're not *productive*.

I wish someone had told me this sooner. It would have saved me years of wasted time. So in this video, I'm going to tell you about everything I wish I knew about productivity before I fell into this trap.

## Lesson 1: Productivity Without Purpose Is Doomed to Fail

Why do you want to be productive? Why do you want to manage your time, set goals, and optimize workflows? Have you ever truly asked yourself this question?

A few months ago, I got myself wondering the same thing. I had never questioned it before because I saw productivity as something inherently good, something that I should strive for. I assumed that being productive was the default and never asked myself why.

I was so obsessed with apps, with techniques, methods, and systems that I lost sight of the bigger picture. I always asked myself *how*, but I never asked myself *why*. And that's the most important question that you can ask yourself: **Why?**
- Why do you want to be productive?
- Why bother at all? After all, you can just sit on a couch and do nothing.

Many of us chase goals that aren't even ours. People pursue careers or lifestyles simply because they look appealing online. Some people pursue degrees because their parents force them to. We think that we want something but do we really?

I feel like our lives are filled with goals and dreams that look appealing, but we have no idea how it feels to actually have the thing. And we try to chase it desperately, but we're not even sure if we need it. We're just pushed into it by external forces, by stuff like social media, by movies, by pop culture. We think we need it, but in reality, we really don't.

It happens because we don't know ourselves. We don't really know what we want and what we need in this life.

Being productive is glamorized in our society. Some people wear working too much, hustling, and burnout like a badge of honor. They believe that grinding all the time leads to success, but in reality, it just leads to depression, burnout, and anxiety.

## The Reality of Productivity

Young people see those influencers and assume that this is exactly how your life should be—that you should be hyper-productive 24/7.

Let me tell you something: **Nobody is productive 24/7.**

Most of the things that you see online are exaggerated or just outright fake. So don't believe everything you see. Don't blame yourself for not being productive simply because people online seem extremely productive. Most of the time, they are not. It's just a picture. These are just recordings. They might record "one day in the life" of this person, and then it turns out that they have been filming it for 2 weeks. So it's not realistic.

Life happens, and that's totally okay.

Ask yourself this simple question: Why do you want to be productive? Why is it important for you? Is it because you saw something online and thought, "Well, I want to be the same way"? Or is it because you have goals that you need to achieve, and you truly want to do it through productivity?

Having a clear "why" gives you strong motivation to stay consistent, to pursue your goals, and push through difficult moments.

I know that it sounds extremely cliché, but I always think of this one quote: "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." Victor Frankl expands on this idea in his book "Man's Search for Meaning."

When you lack motivation and when you don't want to do anything—and we all have those days—your "why" will keep you going. Finding your purpose, finding your "why" will take a lot of time, but once you do, productivity will stop feeling like a struggle. It will be a byproduct of your drive.

## Lesson 2: Obsess Over Work, Not Over Tools

Certain tools work great in one situation and fail miserably in another. The key is recognizing when an app stops serving you and eliminating it as fast as possible.

Despite knowing deep down that Notion wasn't for me, I still kept forcing myself to use it because everybody seemed to like it so much. In the end, I stopped using it anyway because it wasn't right for me, but unfortunately, my time was wasted. If I had switched to Obsidian or Apple Notes timely, I would save so much time and effort.

Just like I said in one of my previous videos about Apple Notes: you don't need complicated tools and systems to be productive. As long as something works for you, you don't need to switch or search for something new.

The whole point of productivity apps is to find something that works for you and stick to it for as long as possible. For most people, popular apps like Google Calendar, Todoist, Notion, or Notes app will be enough, and they don't have to use complicated systems.

Don't search for new apps and don't switch as long as you have a very valid reason to do so. Use as few apps as possible, seriously. Having a lot of apps might sound like a good idea, but actually, it creates unnecessary friction and it makes you less productive.

Here is a simple test that you can do, and I myself did it many times:
1. Write down every app and tool you use
2. Next to each one, explain why it's valuable and how it has actually improved your life

If you find yourself writing things like "I don't use it that often" or "I forget about it," ditch it or find a better replacement.

Most people who binge productivity content fall into this trap: they optimize and tweak their systems for hours instead of getting things done.

Do you think that successful people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, or Elon Musk waste hours trying to find the perfect productivity app? Probably not. I mean, I know they have assistants, but they focus on doing the actual work. So you should probably do the same thing.

## What Sam Altman Says

Listen to what Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has to say about this:

"I think people overcomplicate it. I think this all like 'productivity porn' thing where you have these like systems and like, you know, like these multivariable charts and three-dimensional whatevers—those people never seem to be the people who like really move the world forward."

"I will observe that I think any system, as long as it keeps you disciplined and getting done what you say you're going to get done, is fine. And I think like the simple ones really work."

Optimizing is fine, but if you're constantly wasting time trying to find the perfect system, optimizing it, tweaking it, trying to find the perfect app, then it's just a waste of time. It's a form of procrastination, and deep down, you know that it's true.

At some point, you have to stop optimizing and start building.

## Lesson 3: Work With Your Brain, Not Against It [08:10-10:24]

How many times have you forced yourself to wake up early, to read books, to meditate, or journal simply because some productivity guru on YouTube said that you should?

Productivity isn't about effort. It's about understanding how your brain works. And the best way to do so is to experiment a lot and try to understand how your brain works.

Most advice that we hear online will not be applicable to each and every one of us because we're all different. We all have different brains, we all have different life circumstances, and different mindsets. Some people are neurodivergent, some people have mental or physical illnesses.

That's why giving advice to people and expecting everyone to benefit from it would be naive, to say the least.

Try different techniques and different methods. When something doesn't work for you, don't see it as failure. See it as a new set of data that you can analyze and use to improve yourself. Pay attention to what actually helps you to stay focused and organized.

After seeing something online and implementing that advice, I tend to analyze if it works for me or not. And if it truly doesn't work for me, I would write it down in my notes app, and then I would just forget about it. I wouldn't return to that advice because it means that it's not suitable for my brain.

If you're constantly feeling unmotivated, distracted, or unfocused, maybe it's not about discipline. Maybe it's about the fact that you're working against your natural rhythms.

Instead of trying to be productive all day, try to work in focused sprints when your energy is at its peak. If you're a morning person, then schedule your deep work sessions in the mornings. If you're creative at night, then lean into that and stop fighting yourself.

Instead, get to know yourself, get to know your natural rhythms, your brain, and when you work best. You won't get meaningful results by constantly fighting yourself and your biology. Pushing through fatigue and distractions is not discipline—it's basically inefficient.

We're not the same, and waking up at 5:00 a.m., as good as it sounds, is not realistic for everyone. Work smarter, not harder.

## Conclusion

Remember, it's not about the amount of hours you work in a day. It's actually about the quality of those hours. If you can work for 4 hours but they're extremely productive for you, then there's no reason to work for twice as much.

And you know what? Most people can't work for 10 hours. It's not productive. At some point, you will stop being focused and start wasting time.

Everyone's brain works differently, and that's totally okay. Your job is to find what works best for you. The more you understand your strengths and weaknesses, the easier being productive will be for you. It won't feel like a struggle anymore.

The goal isn't to force yourself into somebody else's routine. It's to stop fighting yourself and building systems that actually work.

Thank you so much for watching this video, and I really hope it was helpful and eye-opening. Write your biggest productivity struggles in the comment section, and maybe we can help each other. Thanks again for your support, and I will see you in the next one.
