## Customization

### Content

The main content of the landing page is stored in the `defaultContent` object within the `page.tsx` file. You can easily modify the text, features, pricing plans, and other content by updating this object.

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the design by modifying the Tailwind classes in the JSX or by updating the `tailwind.config.js` file to change global styles, colors, and other design tokens.

### Components

The landing page is built using modular components. You can find these components in the `components` directory. To add new sections or modify existing ones, you can create or edit the corresponding component files.
